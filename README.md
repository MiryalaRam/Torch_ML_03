#Dog vs. Cat Image Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

#Overview
This repository contains code and resources for building an image classification model to distinguish between dogs and cats. We’ll use Support Vector Machines (SVM) as our machine learning algorithm.

#Dataset
We’ll be using a dataset of labeled dog and cat images. You can download the dataset from here. Make sure to organize the data into separate folders for dogs and cats.

#Prerequisites
Python 3.x
NumPy
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
Scikit-learn (for SVM implementation)

#Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-cat-svm.git
cd dog-cat-svm

Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage
1.Prepare your dataset by placing dog images in the data/dogs folder and cat images in the data/cats folder.
2.Run the preprocessing script to resize and normalize the images:
python preprocess.py

3.Train the SVM model
python train_svm.py

Evaluate the model:
python evaluate.py

#Results
Our SVM model achieved an accuracy of approximately 90% on the test set. Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters or try other classifiers to improve performance.
